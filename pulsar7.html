<p>&quot;Little green men begin to sound more and more plausible,&quot; Donald said as he lay on the grass next to Jacqueline. He had taken her to a show and had been pleased that she had taken the trouble to put on her &quot;women's things.&quot; Behind her prettied-up face, the intelligence that was Jacqueline peered out and frowned disapprovingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't be silly,&quot; she said. &quot;There has to be a perfectly simple explanation, but we just have not thought of it yet. Perhaps the X-ray telescope will tell us something. Fortunately, it scanned over the probable position in the sky in the second day of this week's data collection, so we won't have to wait too long.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Does Sawlinski know about that part of the command?&quot; Donald asked.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Jacqueline said, &quot;I didn't get a chance to tell him. In fact, he has been so busy giving seminars and visiting radio astronomy antenna sites that I haven't seen him for a week.&quot;</p>
<p>Donald looked at his watch and said, &quot;Well, it is almost time for the next data dump. Let's go in and monitor it on the consoles.&quot; They rose and walked through the darkness to the Space Sciences building.</p>
<p>This time the console room held only two people. Donald sat behind Jacqueline and leaned on the back of her chair, smelling her perfume and watching her slender fingers play over the keyboard.</p>
<p>&quot;The X-ray data is in a different format from the radio data since it is just a count of the number of X-ray photons detected,&quot; she said. &quot;First, I will get the directional plot and see if there is any significant increase in counts in the same direction as the low frequency radio experiment detects radio pulses.&quot;</p>
<p>Soon a histogram of pulses versus the direction in the sky flashed on the screen.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at that spike!&quot; Donald said. &quot;Is that the right direction?&quot;</p>
<p><em>&quot;Mais oui!&quot;</em> Jacqueline's fingers stumbled in the excitement, and she had to erase a distorted plot before she slowed down and finally got the computer to show the number of counts versus time when the telescope was pointing in the right direction.</p>
<p>&quot;There they are, just like little soldiers, five times a second!&quot; said Donald.</p>
<p>&quot;5.0183495 times per second,&quot; Jacqueline retorted. &quot;That number is engraved in my memory. What I really hope to get out of this X-ray data is some evidence of delay between the X-ray pulses and the radio pulses. The X-ray pulses will travel at the speed of light, but the radio pulses will be delayed slightly by the interstellar plasma and will arrive later. The more they are delayed, the more plasma they had to travel through. The combination of X-ray data and radio data will give us a rough idea of the distance to the pulsating source.&quot;</p>
<p>As she talked, she was working the keyboard, and soon, underneath the marching row of X-ray spikes, there was a similar row of spikes from the radio antenna.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a good thing you decided to digitalize the radio data sixteen times a second so we could see the individual pulses,&quot; Donald said. &quot;If we had tried four times a second as I recommended, we would have missed most of them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is no delay!&quot; Jacqueline cried, bewildered.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmmm,&quot; said Donald, &quot;maybe the delay is almost exactly 200 milliseconds and they are just shifted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Jacqueline said, pointing to the screen. &quot;Look—there is a very weak X-ray pulse followed by three strong ones and then two weak ones. You can see the exact pattern in the radio pulses, right below them. The delay is almost zero. That must mean that whatever the source of the pulses, it is very close to the detectors.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...and the closest thing to the detectors is the spacecraft itself,&quot; Donald said. &quot;I am afraid that somehow the spacecraft is putting spikes into both the low frequency radio antenna and the X-ray telescope.&quot;</p>
<p>Jacqueline frowned, then quickly produced two more plots with much larger scales. The pulses were now so close together that they were back to being scruff again. But the scruffy region on the X-ray plot was much shorter than on the radio plot.</p>
<p>&quot;No, it is not the spacecraft,&quot; she said. &quot;Look here, the pulses come and go with time much faster for the X-ray telescope than for the radio antenna. The X-ray telescope has a field of view that is limited to one degree, while the high sensitivity spike in the radio antenna has a beam width of almost three degrees, and these plots are consistent with the width of those patterns.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, if it isn't the spacecraft,&quot; said Donald, &quot;then what is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Give me a few minutes,&quot; she said, and went back to typing on the keyboard.</p>
<p>Donald got up, walked down the hall to the coffee machine and bought them both a cup of coffee. It looked like a long evening ahead. When he returned, she had the X-ray and radio-pulse trains up on the screen again, but now they were blown up so far that only three pulses appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a very slight time delay,&quot; she said as he walked in. &quot;I wish I could remember the number density for the interstellar plasma near the sun. I worked out the values for the latest solar wind cycle last month; I will have to go upstairs and look it up.&quot;</p>
<p>She made a hardcopy printout of the graph on the screen, then ran quickly upstairs. Donald followed slowly behind, carrying the two cups of coffee. By the time he made it up the stairs, she had found the number for the interstellar plasma density. She was punching away on her hand calculator when he walked into her office.</p>
<p>&quot;2300 AU!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;That pulsar is only one-thirtieth of a light year away!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A star that close?&quot; Donald asked. &quot;Surely we would have seen it moving across the sky long ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;a pulsar is a spinning neutron star, and a neutron star is only about twenty kilometers in diameter. Even if the temperature were high, the size of the light-emitting area is so small that we wouldn't be able to see it unless we looked in just the right place with a very large telescope. But you are right, it is strange that it has not been picked up in one of the sky surveys.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If the pulsar is that close, then why didn't the radio astronomers find the pulses too?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Neutron stars give off their radiation in beams that shoot out from the magnetic poles, and you have to be in the direction of the beam to see the pulses,&quot; she replied. &quot;That is why the spacecraft sees the pulses and we can't. The spacecraft is up out of the ecliptic by 200 AU and has moved up into the path of the beams.&quot; She walked over to the whiteboard in the office, picked up a colored marker, and started to pace and scribble.</p>
<p>Donald kept silent as slender feet clicked back and forth across the floor in their dress shoes. He waited patiently while long fingers scrawled diagrams and calculations on the board. He watched in admiration as the pretty face puzzled out the complexity of the mathematical transformation from one set of astrophysical coordinates to another. Five minutes later, he was still admiring Jacqueline from behind when she finally turned and spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;It is up in the northern sky,&quot; she said. &quot;But it is not where we thought it was. Because the neutron star is so close, there is a difference of over five degrees in the angle from the spacecraft to the star and from the earth to the star. No wonder the radio astronomers could not find it. We told them the wrong direction.&quot;</p>
<p>She went over to a star chart on her wall and carefully made a tiny cross. She turned and, with a wry grin on her face, remarked, &quot;And the reason it was never picked up in a sky survey is that it is right next to Giansar, the fourth magnitude star right at the end of Draco, the Dragon constellation. It would take a good telescope to see the neutron star image in that bright glare.&quot;</p>
<p>She drank down the rest of her coffee.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's go wake up old Saw-face,&quot; she said. &quot;We've got a paper to publish.&quot;</p>
